# PWA-Text_Editor

## Description:
  
A progressive web application text editor that uses indexedDB and service workers for offline use.
  - My motivation for this project was to better understsand how webpack works. 
  - I built this application to gain a foundational understanding of webpack, so when I start using React I am familiar with the process that is happening behind the scenes.
